# Fix Service Worker Registration Error (Issue #1877)

## Description
This PR implements a comprehensive fix for the service worker registration error that causes the grey window issue in long conversations. The fix includes webview state management, automatic recovery mechanisms, and enhanced error detection.

## Related Issue
Fixes #1877 - Service Worker Registration Error causing grey window

## Type of Change
- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [x] Performance improvement

## Changes Made

### 1. Webview State Management (`src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts`)
- Added webview state tracking (`loading`, `ready`, `error`, `disposed`)
- Implemented error count tracking with automatic recovery
- Added memory monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Created webview recovery mechanism with automatic retry logic

### 2. Enhanced Error Detection (`webview-ui/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Added specific detection for service worker errors
- Implemented automatic notification to extension backend
- Enhanced error reporting with detailed context

### 3. Recovery Commands (`src/activate/registerCommands.ts`)
- Added `kilocode.recoverWebview` command for manual recovery
- Added `kilocode.restartExtension` command for complete restart
- Integrated with webview state management

### 4. Webview Communication (`webview-ui/src/App.tsx`)
- Added `webviewReady` message to establish communication
- Enhanced startup sequence for better error detection

### 5. Memory Management (`webview-ui/src/services/MemoryService.ts`)
- Added cache management for memory optimization
- Implemented memory warning handling
- Added automatic cache clearing on memory pressure

## Technical Implementation

### Webview State Management
```typescript
private webviewState: 'loading' | 'ready' | 'error' | 'disposed' = 'loading'
private webviewErrorCount = 0
private readonly MAX_WEBVIEW_ERRORS = 3
```

### Automatic Recovery
- Detects service worker registration failures
- Automatically attempts webview recovery
- Implements exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Provides user notifications for manual intervention

### Memory Monitoring
- Monitors memory usage every 30 seconds
- Triggers cache clearing at 500MB threshold
- Provides memory usage notifications to users

## Testing
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] Error simulation testing
- [x] Memory pressure testing
- [x] Recovery mechanism validation

## How to Test

### Test Service Worker Error Recovery
1. Start a long conversation in Kilo Code
2. Simulate service worker error (or wait for natural occurrence)
3. Verify automatic recovery mechanism activates
4. Check that webview state is properly managed

### Test Manual Recovery Commands
1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
2. Run `Kilo Code: Recover Webview`
3. Verify webview recovers properly
4. Test `Kilo Code: Restart Extension` if needed

### Test Memory Management
1. Monitor memory usage in long conversations
2. Verify cache clearing at memory thresholds
3. Check memory warning notifications

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [x] Self-review of code completed
- [x] Code is commented where necessary
- [x] Documentation is updated if needed
- [x] Changes generate no new warnings
- [x] Manual testing completed

## Additional Notes

### Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact from state tracking
- Memory monitoring runs every 30 seconds
- Cache clearing only triggers under memory pressure

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Graceful degradation if new features fail

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding telemetry for error tracking
- Implement more sophisticated memory management
- Add configuration options for thresholds
